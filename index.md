# A journey into the land of keyboards

This is my journal into the land of keyboards.  As a software engineer there are many hours spent using a keyboard so I figured why not make it a positive experience and get to know my daily companion a little better.  I have long appreciated the experience of using a good mechanical keyboard.  Being new to the hobby (I expect this will approach that level) and with so much to learn.


## Pieces and Parts
Here are some links that I have discovered related to the various components of a keyboard.

### Switches
Different types and colors and mechanics...

### Caps
Different types and profiles galore.

### Circuits / PCBs
Information on the matrix structure used:
 - [How to make a keyboard - the matrix](http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/)
 - [YouTube series on designing/making PCB/etc.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWGAJr2AU7LPUwVYbBQZRg)
 - Looks like the [ATMEGA-32u4](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32u4) is used often.

### Software / Firmware
 - What runs on the microcontroller in a keyboard [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).  I really want to check this out more.
 - Help make real-time changes to your keyboard software [Via](https://caniusevia.com/)

### Sites
 - [Geek Hack Forums](https://geekhack.org/)
 - [Reddit Mechanical Keyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalKeyboards/)
 - [Open source Hardware for a 60%](http://blog.komar.be/)
