# A journey into the land of keyboards

This is a journal of my trip into the land of keyboards.  As a software engineer there are many hours spent using a keyboard so I figured why not make it a more positive experience and get to know my daily companion a little better.  There is a lot of engineering that goes into this seemingly simple device and it seems like fun to learn more about it.

## Builds
Collection of my keyboard builds.

 - [The first one (do you name these things?)](builds/first.md)

# Pieces and Parts
Here are some links related to the various components of a keyboard.

### Switches
Different types and colors and mechanics...  TODO: link to some interesting components.

### Caps
Different types and profiles galore.... TODO: link to some interesting components.

### Cases
All types of materials are used.  Seems that aluminum and plastic-like materials are most common.  Would really like to look into wood.

### Circuits / PCBs
Information on the matrix structure used:
 - [How to make a keyboard - the matrix](http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/)
 - [YouTube series on designing/making PCB/etc.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpWGAJr2AU7LPUwVYbBQZRg)
 - Looks like the [ATMEGA-32u4](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32u4) is used often.

### Software / Firmware
 - What runs on the microcontroller in a keyboard [QMK](https://qmk.fm/).  I really want to check this out more.  (I expect there are others - maybe?)
 - Help make real-time changes to your keyboard with this software: [Via](https://caniusevia.com/)

### Sites
 - [Geek Hack Forums](https://geekhack.org/)
 - [Reddit Mechanical Keyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalKeyboards/)
 - [Open source Hardware for a 60%](http://blog.komar.be/)
 - like most things... there is a lot out there.

## Other areas of research

 - Making more of the components from scratch - wood case, wrist rests, 3d-printing, etc.
 - Custom milling or cutting of plate - CNC, laser, water, manual, etc.
 - Through-hole PCB vs. surface mount.
 - KiCad and Fusion 360 for designing.
